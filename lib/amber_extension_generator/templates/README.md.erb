# <%= root_module_name %>

Welcome to your [amber_component](https://github.com/amber-ruby/amber_component/) component pack! In this directory, you'll find the files you need to be able to package up your Ruby library into a gem. Put your Ruby code in the file `<%= gem_entry_folder_path %>`. To experiment with that code, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt.

TODO: Delete this and the text above, and describe your gem

## Installation

Install the gem and add to the application's Gemfile by executing:

```sh
$ bundle add <%= gem_name %>
```

If bundler is not being used to manage dependencies, install the gem by executing:

```sh
$ gem install <%= gem_name %>
```

Afterwards you need to import this gem's SCSS stylesheet like so:

```scss
@import "<%= gem_name_path %>";
```

If you're using Rails, that line should be appended to `app/assets/stylesheets/application.scss`.

There is a generator that does it for you.

```sh
bin/rails generate <%= gem_name_rake %>:install
```

## Usage

TODO: Write usage instructions here

## Development

### Setup

To setup this gem for development you should run the setup script.
This should install all dependencies and make the gem ready.

```sh
$ bin/setup
```

### Console

To make development and experimenting easier there is a script
that lets you access an IRB with this entire gem preloaded.

```sh
$ bin/console
```

### Development app

There is a dummy Rails app in `dummy_app` which has this gem installed and configured
for hot-reloading. You don't have to restart the server when you make changes to your gem,
it will reload automatically.

You can start it by running

```sh
$ bin/dev
```

You can use it to experiment with your components.

### Generating new components

You can generate new component by running

```sh
$ bin/generate component button
```

This will create a few files:
- the logic/mini controller of your component `<%= gem_entry_folder_path %>/components/button_component.rb` containing `<%= root_module_name %>::ButtonComponent`
- your component's template/view `<%= gem_entry_folder_path %>/components/button_component/view.html.erb`
- your component's stylesheet `<%= gem_entry_folder_path %>/components/button_component/style.scss`
- your component's test file `<%= gem_test_folder_path %>/components/button_component_test.rb`

The stylesheet of your new component will be automatically imported
in `assets/stylesheets/<%= gem_name_path %>/components.scss`.

More details on how these components work can be found at [amber_component](https://github.com/amber-ruby/amber_component).

### Tests

You can run all tests like this.

```sh
$ bundle exec rake test
```

You can unit test your components using the custom test suite which provides
handy assertions for the HTML rendered by your component.
More details can be found at [amber_component](https://github.com/amber-ruby/amber_component).

### Release

To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run

```sh
$ bundle exec rake release
```

This will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and the created tag, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).

### Local installation

To install this gem onto your local machine, run

```sh
$ bundle exec rake install
```
